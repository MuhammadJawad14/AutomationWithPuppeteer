What are the prerequisites of cloning a puppeteer project from git repository?
To clone a Puppeteer project from a repository (e.g., a Git repository), you'll need to have a few prerequisites in place. Puppeteer is a Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers, so you should ensure that your environment is set up properly. Here are the typical prerequisites:

**1.	Node.js:** Puppeteer is built on top of Node.js, so you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

**2.	Git:** You'll need Git to clone the project from a Git repository. You can download and install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/

**3.	A code editor:** You'll need a code editor to work with the Puppeteer project. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text etc. You can choose the one that you are most comfortable with.
Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can proceed to clone a Puppeteer project from a repository. Here are the general steps:

1.	Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2.	Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Puppeteer project.

3.	Use the git clone command to clone the repository. For example:
git clone https://github.com/username/puppeteer-project.git 
Replace the URL with the actual URL of the Puppeteer project repository you want to clone.

4.	After cloning the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal using the cd command. For example:
cd puppeteer-project 

5.	Once you're inside the project directory, you can install the project's dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager) by running:
npm install 

6.	Now you can start working with the Puppeteer project.
